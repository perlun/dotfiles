These are my settings for [Karabiner Elements](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/). Use them if you like, or make your own mapping inspired by these changes.

Overview of the changes they make:

- For my external PC-style keyboard, Cmd and Alt are swapped (so that we use the Apple standard with Cmd next to the Space key.)
- The key right to Shift is mapped to `~ instead of its default (which is a quite meaningless +- character.)
- Caps Lock is mapped to F14 (this is used to be able to swap between US and Swedish keymaps easily. I use US keymap as the default, which works great for programming, but switch many times a day to Swedish which is useful when chatting with colleagues in my native language.)

For details on how to symlink this into your `~/.config/karabiner` folder, see this link: https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/issues/597
