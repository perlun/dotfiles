This is a collection of my personal OS X settings. Feel free to use them in any way you like.

Some highly recommended tools:

- [Fink](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fink/): Gives you easy access to the necessary stuff, like GNU userland (findutils, coreutils etc), command-line Mercurial, etc.
- [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com): Very good replacement for the built-in terminal app in OS X.
- [KeyRemap4MacBook](http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/): This is an incredibly useful tool if you're coming from a PC background, used to a "traditional" PC laptop keyboard. The Apple choices for the key placements are simply quite horrible, if you ask me. Not one single modifier key (Control, Fn, Option, Cmd etc) is on the same place as on my other PC keyboard, so some remapping is simply necessary to retain my mental health.
- [Mou](http://mouapp.com/): Markdown-editor which works quite well, and has a nice preview pane also.
- [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com): A great virtualization app, to be able to run Windows 7, Visual Studio, Microsoft Office etc.
- [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/): Graphical Mercurial and Git-client. Developed by Atlassian, the company who provides the [Bitbucket](http://www.bitbucket.org) hosted Mercurial/Git services.
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com): Powerful text editor for pose users.
