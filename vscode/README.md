Symlink `settings.json` to the correct folder:

- On Linux:
  - `ln -sf ~/git/dotfiles/vscode/settings.json ~/.config/Code/User`

You may optionally use the `keybindings.json` file in the same manner. For
now, this file is mostly macOS-centric; I haven't yet adjusted it to my
brave new GNU/Linux world.
